# utils/helpers.R
# Funciones auxiliares para inputs, centrado, validaci√≥n, etc.
# No functions currently defined in this file after removal of centrar_en.
# This file can be kept for future helper functions or removed if not needed.

# The 'centrar_en' function was removed as it was not used by any module.
# Original function provided simulated coordinates for map centering.
# If similar functionality is needed, it should be re-evaluated and potentially
# integrated with APP_CONFIG or a geocoding service.
